# Router selenium port rules adder

### Auto Port Forwarding Script made for routers without ssh/telnet access, only web config
**Tested on Huawei HG6544C (FiberHome firmware variant)**

## Overview


### PortCheck is a Python automation tool that:

- Checks if a specific port on a public hostname is open.
- If the port is closed, it runs a Selenium script to log into your router and re-add the port forwarding rule.
- Supports multiple port forwarding rules.
- Runs automatically on a schedule using systemd timers.

---

### Features

- Multiple rules: Configure multiple (Private IP, Public Port, Private Port) rules.
- Smart add: Only adds a rule if itâ€™s missing.
- Verification: Confirms the rule exists after adding.
- Automation: Runs automatically via systemd timer.
- Virtual environment: Isolated Python environment for dependencies.
